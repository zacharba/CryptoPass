# CryptoPass

## Introduction

Poject Summary: Create a browser extension-based application that can not only manage and save online passwords, but also inform you of unsafe password practice, prevent reuse of passwords and notify you if any of your passwords have been breached.

Problem Statement: Keeping track of different passwords for various web accounts can be troublesome for many online users.  Contrarily, using the same password for multiple accounts can result in a compromise of personal information. 22.5% of people use a password manager and 25% of people use the same password or a variation of the same password (passwordmanager.com). With this, 11,923,631,961 accounts are recorded as breached or compromised due to popular websites or applications experiencing data breaches (haveibeenpwned.com)

Solution: Because many online users may find it difficult to remember all their passwords, we want to create an online password manager that can log userâ€™s passwords and keep track of which ones belong to each account.  Our password manager will be in the form of a browser extension, in order to allow users to easily input their passwords when logging into their accounts.  To combat bad password creating practices, the browser extension-based application will alert the user if a password they try to use is already associated with another account or too weak.  It will also notify the user whenever any of their accounts have been breached. 

## Storyboard



## Project Objectives/Goals: 

1. Improve project productivity and performance.  
  A. Improve scope-setting methods in the initiation phase to improve upon the project productivity and performance.  

2. Increase transparency and secure application management.  
  A. Transparency on any updates that will securely protect the application while maintaining management. The updates would be rolled out silently, roughly every 6     months or when needed. 

3. Project focuses on cost reduction while maintaining efficiency.  
  A. Improving the quality of the application while allowing for cost reduction.  

4. Customer/User Experience  
  A. While maintaining and pursuing the project scope for the application, the team will work to improve customer/user experience.  

5. Information Security  
  A. The application is developed to handle and prevent security threats to protect confidential user data. This would be accomplished by not allowing users to use the same password more than once. All password data will be encrypted.
